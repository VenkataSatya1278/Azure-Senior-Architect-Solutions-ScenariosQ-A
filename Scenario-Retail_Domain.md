## Scenario :   
Your are tasked to designing a cloud native e-commerce platform for rapidly growing online retail business. The platform needs to handle millions of users, provide real-time product recommendations, and ensure high availability during peak traffic. The business also requires a cost-effective solution. Design the applicaiton architecture considering scalability, availability, security and cost optimization.  


## Solution:

Presentation Layer: Use Azure App Service for the web front end, providing a scalable and fully managed platform. Enable auto-scaling based on demand during peak hours. Implement Azure Front Door for global load balancing and DDos protection.  

Applicaiton Layer: Containerize microservices using AKS to enable efficient scaling and management. Utilize Azure API management to expose and manage API securely.  

Data Processing Layer: Implement Azure Functions for serverless, event-driven comute to handle asynchrnous tasks and backend processes. Use Azure Evet Hubs for ingesting and processing real-time streaming data, such as user interations.  

Data Storage Layer: Utilize Azure Cosmos DB as the multi-model database to store prduct information, user profiles, and real-time data. Leverage Cosmos DB's global distribution for low-latency acccess worldwide.  

Cacing Layer: Integrate Azure Cache for Redis to cache frequently accessed data and reduce latency, enhancing the overall performance of the platform.  

Authentication and Authorization: Implement Azure Active Directory for user authentication and authorization. Enable multi-Factor Authentication for enhanced Security.  

Monitoring and Logging: Use Azure Monitor for applicaiton performance monitoring, logging, and diagnostics. Leverage Azure Application Insights for real-time insights into applicaiton behavior.  

Security and Compliance: Implement Azure Key Vault for secure storage of sensitive information, such as API keys and connetion strings. Utilize Azure security Center for continuous security monitoring and compliance.  

Cost Optimization: Explore Azure Cost Management and Billing to monitor, analyze, and optimize costs. Utilize Azure Reserved Instances for comupute resources and consider serverless options to optimize costs during low traffic periods.  

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement Azure Backups of critical data. Setup geo-redundancy for Azure Cosmos DB and use Azure site recovery for a robust disaster recovery strategy.
